**Hematopoieteic Stem Cells** are pluripotent stem cells that can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It has the characteristics of self-renewal and replication. It divides from one cell into two cells, which is double the growth. Hematopoietic stem cells produce billions of new blood cells every day and are responsible for constantly renewing blood. Hematopoietic stem cells can be obtained from cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood from adults. It is generally used for blood and immune diseases, such as blood cancer, thalassemia, etc.

### HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION

Prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, cancer cells in patients are destroy through high-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Then autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells are reinfused into the vein or given to the patient so that the patient can rebuild normal hematopoietic cells and immune functions. In recent years, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation technology has gradually matured. It has been recognized by the medical profession and being widely used to cure leukaemia, hereditary and severe immune diseases.
