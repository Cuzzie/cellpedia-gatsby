In accordance with the international standards, stem cells should be processed in laboratories certified by Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S).

The federal government established a standard for laboratories and medical equipments, where it has to be cGMP certified. cGMP favors systems with proper design, close monitoring techniques, and also having complete control over all manufacturing processes within a facility. Adherence to cGMP regulations assures the identity, strength, quality and purity of drug products produced are maintained. Establishing strong quality management systems includes obtaining appropriate quality raw materials, establishing robust operating procedures, detecting and investigating product quality deviations, and maintaining reliable laboratory tests. This formal system of controls at a pharmaceutical company, if adequately put into practice, helps in preventing instances of contamination, mix-ups, deviations, failures, and errors.

The law in certain countries established regulations which require private stem cell banks to achieve the similar standard as the public stem cell banks. However in most countries, the requirements and standards established by the federal government for private stem cell banks are not as stringent as the public stem cell banks. Thus, private stem cell banks could only attain accreditations and certifications on a voluntary basis. For example, the The Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe & EBMT (JACIE) accreditation in Europe and the GMP standards established by the The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States of America.

The FDA applies GMP standards to production of vast pharmaceutical products and medical equipments. The new FDA BLA (Biologics License Application) requires public cord blood banks to run operations of their laboratories similar to that of drug manufacturers and comply with the GMP standards. cGMP requirements were established to be flexible in order to allow manufacturers to decide individually how to best implement the necessary controls by using design, processing , methods, and testing procedures that are scientifically sound. The flexibility in these regulations allows companies to use modern technologies and take innovative approaches to achieve higher quality through continual improvement. The alphabet “c” in cGMP stands for ‘current’. Just as the name suggests, companies are required to use technologies and systems that are up-to-date in order to comply with the regulations.

In addition, cells must be tested in accordance with the International Society for Cellular Therapy and the best practices in the industry, whereby the cells 1) has to be plastic adherent when kept under standard culture conditions 2) express proper positive and negative MSC markers and 3) retain a multipotent phenotype with the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, under the standard differentiation conditions.
